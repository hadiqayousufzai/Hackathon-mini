 <h1> <img src="profile 4.png" alt=""> An Action Button Could Be Coming to the iPhone 15</h1>
<p>Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone. According to a July report from MacRumors, code in the fourth iOS 17 developer beta hints at functionality for an Action button on the next-gen iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models.
    <br>
    Apple introduced the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on the side of the Apple Watch Ultra that allows you to run a preselected function or program when you press it without unlocking your device or navigating to an app. Some of the preselected functions include starting a stopwatch, 
    beginning a workout and turning on your flashlight.</p>

<h1> <img src="profile 4.png" alt=""> What Is the Event Loop and How Does It Improve App Performance?</h1>
<p>
    JavaScript is a single-threaded language, built to handle tasks one at a time. However, the 
    event loop lets JavaScript handle events and callbacks asynchronously by emulating simultaneous programming systems. This assures the performance of your JavaScript applications. JavaScript is a single-threaded language, built to handle tasks one at a time.
